# 🧮 Cognifyz Level 1 Task 2 - Interactive Web App

This is a simple web application that includes:

1. A button that changes its color through multiple colors when clicked.  
2. A basic calculator that adds two numbers and displays the result.  
3. An alert that shows a greeting message based on the current time of day.



## 📌 Features

✔️ **Color-Changing Button**  
Cycles through a list of colors (`blue`, `green`, `red`, `yellow`, `purple`, `orange`) every time you click the button.

✔️ **Time-Based Greeting**  
Displays a greeting based on the time of day when the page is loaded:
- **Good Morning** before 12 PM  
- **Good Afternoon** from 12 PM to 6 PM  
- **Good Evening** after 6 PM

✔️ **Basic Calculator**  
Allows the user to input two numbers, adds them together, and displays the result on the screen.

✔️ **Thank You Message**  
The page ends with a large, styled "**Thank You !!**" message for a pleasant closing.
